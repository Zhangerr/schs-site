			I know many of you couldn't (or didn't) come to the meeting this Tuesday but what we basically did was a quick overview of how to collaborate on the website with <a href="http://selenic.mercurial.com">mercurial</a> (a source control system that keeps track of changes to files), i.e. how to download a local copy of the website (cloning) and commit one's changes (pushing).</p>
			<p>A good question is <strong>why mercurial?</strong> Why go through all this effort on learning this software?</p>
			<p>The primary reason is so we can <strong>collaborate</strong> on the website in an organized fashion, therefore enabling us to work simultaneously. Mercurial keeps track of the <strong>changes</strong> to files over time and lets us see <strong>who</strong> made that change. Think of it like savepoints in a game. You typically want to save everytime you make some progress. Same idea with mercurial. You can revert back to past versions at any time (like a game), and people people will be able to <strong>download</strong> your changes and vice versa.</p>
			<p>So in essence if one of us makes changes the rest of us can see what was changed and download that change; and if anytime the need arise to view a past version we can easily do so.</p>
			<p>I realized most people won't remember how to do it from such brief explanation and that most people weren't present I decided just to write a quick guide/tutorial on using mercurial with some screenshots for you visual learners.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll be describing how to clone, commit, and pull two different ways
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Command line</b>, which is more powerful and flexible but has a steeper learning curve (which I personally use and recommend but will only briefly go over)
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Graphical</b>, which is much more intuitive but ultimately slower.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            And for clarity's sake, let me define what exactly cloning, committing, and pulling are.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Cloning</b> is as the name implies -- you make a copy of the remote repository, a fancy word for database, on your local machine (computer). In this case, we'll be cloning the website repository from the google code repository so we can collaborate on it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Committing</b> is when you save the changes you made to the site files and store it as a logical revision, which is basically a save point of the file that can be restored anytime. With mercurial, you commit locally (onto your own computer opposed to a server) but then you <strong>push</strong> your commits to the master server (in this case google code). You will commit the changes you make and push them to the google code repository.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Pulling</b> is the opposite of a push -- you push your own changes but then you pull other people's changes then update to the new revision. This is the most vital step for collaboration: being able to download other people's work!
            </li>
			<li>
			Also note that a <b>repository</b> is just a fancy word for a database.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            And a quick note, none of this guide is a substitute for reading hginit.com, think of this more like a quick start/cheat sheet sort of thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            So without further ado:
          </p>
          <hr>
          <a id="cl"></a>
          <h3>
            The Command Line Method
          </h3>
          <p>
            So first of all, basically in order to use command line you first need a terminal for your respective computer; for Macs that would just be built in terminal but for Windows you probably should install <a href="http://cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>. Cygwin is an alternative command line for windows. Using the actual windows command line <code>cmd</code> is possible but requires setting the path and more effort, and will not be covered here for brevity.
          </p>After getting your terminal you now need to actually download mercurial. Unless you're using cygwin, you're going to want to download mercurial for your respective OS from <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads">here</a> and install it. For Cygwin, simply install the "mercurial" package from the <code>setup.exe</code> to get hg (aka mercurial).<br>
          <br>
          You then need to configure your terminal so you can directly type <code>hg</code> and get something like this:<br>
          <br>
          <pre>
Alex@Alex-PC ~
$ hg
Mercurial Distributed SCM

basic commands:

 add        add the specified files on the next commit
 annotate   show changeset information by line for each file
 ...
</pre>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, configuring whatever terminal you use to do this is beyond the scope of this tutorial but 10 minutes or so on Google should be more than enough time to find out how.
          </p>
          <p>
            Configuring the terminal is the hardest part; the rest of the steps are comparatively easy.
          </p>
		  <a id="cl_cloning"></a>
          <h4>
            Cloning
          </h4>Okay, to clone with the command line is really simple. Make sure you're signed into google (I should've already added you to the project) and go to the project web page at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/schs-site">here</a> then navigate to the <code>Source</code> tab. You should see a something that says<br>
          <br>
          <pre>
Get a local copy of the schs-site repository with this command:

hg clone https://alexzhangh@code.google.com/p/schs-site/ 

To push your changes, authenticate with your Google Account and your generated googlecode.com password.
</pre>Copy and paste the command into your terminal and run it.
          <div class="alert-block alert">
			<i class="icon-warning-sign"></i> <strong>Warning!</strong> Be sure you don't copy and paste from this tutorial and use YOUR personal link. Note how the example says "alexzhangh@code.google.com," it is specifically for me. Yours should have your google account name in front of the @.
          </div>
          <p>
            Optionally, you can add a folder name as the last parameter like this
          </p>
          <pre>
hg clone https://alexzhangh@code.google.com/p/schs-site/ schsite
</pre>
<p>if you don't want the default folder name.</p>
          <div class="alert alert-success">
           <i class="icon-ok-circle"></i>  <strong>You're set!</strong> Start making changes to your heart's content.
          </div>
		  <a id="cl_commit"></a>
		  <h4>Committing & Pushing</h4>
		  <p>Alright, so you've made a couple of changes, poked around, etc. Now you're ready to make a logical saving point (think of saving your progress in a game) and/or share your 
		  changes with others and the world!</p>
		  <p>Before executing any of these commands you should <code>cd</code> to the repository directory, which should look something like this (highly system dependent)</p>
		  <pre>Alex@Alex-PC ~
$ cd alex

Alex@Alex-PC ~/alex
$ cd desktop

Alex@Alex-PC ~/alex/desktop
$ cd schssite/repo

Alex@Alex-PC ~/alex/desktop/schssite/repo
$
</pre>
<p>Basically you are changing your current working directory to the repository folder (schsite/repo is where it's saved for me, notice the last line shows my current working directory. You <strong>must</strong> do this for any of the mercurial commands to work.</p>
<div class="alert-block alert alert-warning">
			<i class="icon-ok"></i> <strong>Tip:</strong> If you don't know what I mean by "cd" you may need to read this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)">wikipedia article.</a> I can't explain everything in this tutorial
			and part of learning computer-related stuff involves a lot of googling :)
          </div>
		  <p>Before you commit, if you added <strong>any</strong> new files you first need to add them to mercurial like so</p>
<pre>Alex@Alex-PC ~/alex/desktop/schssite/repo
$ hg add hgtutorial.html
</pre>
<p>You <i>must</i> do this so mercurial knows what files to track changes; it may seem silly but some projects have very large files and this prevents them from being automatically added, at the cost of small hassle.</p>
<p><span class="label label-info">Note</span> You can add entire folders as well, not just individual files. Or use the * wildcard to indicate all files in the current directory.</p>
		  
		  <p>Now that you've added all the new files you made, you can go ahead and commit like so:</p>
		  <pre>
Alex@Alex-PC ~/alex/desktop/schssite/repo
$ hg commit -m "tutorial v2"</pre>
<p>This will add commit your changes to the repository <strong>locally</strong> so you still need to <strong>push</strong> your work to google code.</p>
          
		
		<p>So we have our changes committed, and now we need to push to google code. No problem, this is the easiest step. Just type</p>
		<pre>hg push</pre>
		<p>while your current directory is the repository. You should see something like this</p>
		<pre>Alex@Alex-PC ~/alex/desktop/schssite/repo
$ hg push
pushing to https://alexzhangh@code.google.com/p/schs-site/

		<p>If your push was successful, your changes should now be available to download from the google code server!</p>
		           <div class="alert alert-success">
			<i class="icon-ok-circle"></i> <strong>You're set!</strong> Now everyone else will be able to download your changes.
          </div>
		<a id="cl_pulling"></a>
		<h4>Pulling</h4>
		<p>Pulling is probably the most vital step as it's what lets us collaborate. To pull, simply type <pre>hg pull</pre> and then <pre>hg update</pre> (you <strong>must</strong> update to actually have the changes). Sometimes there will be conflicts (i.e. your changes clash with the someone else's) but usually they can be resolved automatically; read <a href="hginit.com">http://hginit.com</a> to learn manually resolve conflicts.</p>
		<p>If all goes well, you should have the latest version of the repository.</p>

		<h3>GUI Method</h3>
		<p>
		All of the GUI tutorial is for windows only, unfortunately. You will need to download and install TortoiseHg to follow along with the instuctions and screenshots.
